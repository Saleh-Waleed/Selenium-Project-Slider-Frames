Dear Yasir Bhai,

I trust this message finds you well. As my probationary period has concluded, I respectfully request that my performance be reviewed.

Throughout my probation period, I have demonstrated dedication to understanding my role and responsibilities. My contributions have been significant, and I believe they have positively impacted the company's overall success.

My commitment to delivering the highest quality work and furthering the company's growth and success is a testament to my dedication. Therefore, I am confident that a salary increase would be an appropriate acknowledgment of my contributions and a motivational factor to maintain the same level of performance.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a fruitful discussion during our next meeting.

Respectfully,

Saleh Waleed
SQA Engineer
